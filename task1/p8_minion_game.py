    - Kevin scores every substring that starts with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U).
    - Stuart scores every substring that starts with a consonant.

    A letter at index i in a word of length n starts (n - i) substrings.

    Return:
    - "Stuart <score>" if Stuart wins,
    - "Kevin <score>" if Kevin wins,
    - "Draw" if the scores are equal.

    Example: "BANANA" -> "Stuart 12".
